# Consulting 

I usually work with web-based businesses but there are exceptions. Past clients include early-stage SaaS startups, academic researchers, e-commerce companies and independent creators. In my consulting, I offer a specific combination of reviewing both the data-strategy & the customer-experience strategy, to asssist clients in need of external help to tune the product-market fit of their business.

My consulting practice can involve: reviewing/architecting data-systems for analytics, reviewing customer-experience strategy and assisting the product-development team. More importantly, it involves sensemaking sessions with the management to connect the dots to discover blind-spots in their customer-experience strategy. 

# What have I worked on

* CX Strategy: Reviewing customer-journey for online consumer-businesses to discover blind-spots in their customer-experience strategy and offering specific recommendations to refactor. Example: review & reconfiguring the customer-experience strategy of an emerging mountainbike-lighting brand to remove 'conversion-blockers' from the existing customer-journey map. 

* Data-Strategy: Creating interactive visualizations of critical data to provide the big-picture for decision-making and offer recommendations on where-to-look. Example: an interactive network-map for an online network of independent consultant/creators to generate new collaborations and enable self-assembly of teams for collaborative projects.  

* Data Systems: Architecting digital system-of-record using low-code/ no-code tools. Examples: a content production system and an inventory-management database.
