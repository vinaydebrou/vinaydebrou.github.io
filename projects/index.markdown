I am an independent consultant and a steward of data and brand strategy for businesses that leverage the web for their survival.

I am an experimenting generalist. My background by education is in computer science. I attended the *Computer Science & Engineering* undergraduate program of India’s top engineering college, Indian Institute of Technology.

In my 3 years of professional experience, I have helped clients navigate the subtleties of the web. My clients include web-based businesses trying to reach product-market fit, independent creators/researchers and senior executives in need of stewardship assistance. 

------------

**May 2020 Update:** I'm accepting new projects to: 

* Build digital systems for businesses, researchers and executives. 

* Formulate brand-strategy for web-based businesses

* Make sense of the data using data-science tools and strategy heuristics 

If you want to discuss a project opportunity with me, the best way to start the conversation is to drop an email to vinaydebrou@gmail.com. 


# Consulting 

I usually work with web-based businesses. Past clients include early-stage SaaS startups, e-commerce companies and independent creators. In my consulting, I offer a specific combination of strategy & stewardship to clients in need of external help to tune the Product-Market Fit of their business.

Even though I have the experience of doing stewardship work in specific domain silos, my consulting service is not so much about implementing a domain-specific feature. It's centered around helping a client traverse through the messy process of configuring together the multiple moving pieces of a relatively new web-based business into a coherent-enough go-to-market strategy.

This can involve helping the client as needed with: market-research, conversion-rate optimization, data analytics, configuring brand-strategy and product-development assistance. More importantly, it involves sensemaking sessions with the client to connect the dots across these domains to come up with a 'more whole' strategy and an implementation plan.

# Past Projects

The domains in which I have assisted my past clients include:

* Making sense of the data using data-science tools and business heuristics; and offer recommendations for the go-to-market strategy.

* Build a digital system using low-code/ no-code tools. Examples include a content production system, an inventory-management database & an e-commerce store.

* Review the conversion-funnel structure for conversion-rate optimization (and stewardship from website design, web-copy to email campaigns) 

* Reformulate the brand strategy for the web and aligning the customer-acquisition approach to that.
