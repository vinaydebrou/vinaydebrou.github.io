### **Who is DayBrew's Note for:**

- Location-independent free-agents (or aspiring ones) who believe in the growth-accelerating power of interdisciplinary learning and collaboration.
- Self-starter learners who want to discover frontier signal ideas that stand out from the information-noise of clickbait media.

### **I promise DayBrew's Note will help you adopt a free-agent perspective and:**

- Discover interdisciplinary ideas that you wouldn't find elsewhere: *including on living spaces, internet-business, process-design, creative machines, niche subcultures, meaning-making.*
- Get acquainted with processes, tools, and frameworks to better align yourself with the inner-game of the network economy.
