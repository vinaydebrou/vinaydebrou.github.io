My name is Vinay Débrou.

I’m an experimenting generalist. I like reading, eating watermelon with black coffee and long walks in the nature.

My background by education is computer science. As an independent contractor and consultant, I have worked with clients on data-analytics, e-commerce branding strategy, web-content production and designing digital systems among other things.

My current learning interests are small-world networks, living space design, small cities, neural networks, classical stoicism, and small virtual communities.
