# Coffee

I like black coffee. 

In 2019, there are many ways to make it. Commercial companies slightly change the method of intake, brewing and/or the pouring of the juice that comes from these magicbeans and sell new coffee-machines with another term coined every year or so. 

If you take a walk in one of the alleys of Intellectual-Twitter, it is likely you'll overhear the debates on the supremacy of this method or that source.   

I like black coffee. 

I like convenience too. That means - Instant coffee is my good friend. It is cheap, functionally good, accessible everywhere, and quick to make.  I'm not really a fan of the taste but I don't mind it as I drink it for the function more than the taste.

*BEFORE THE WATER [goes in my cup]* 

Particularly while brainstorming new ideas, I have to admit I now kind of rely upon it. Thank God it exists in my lifetime. But it didn't exist 200 years ago. 

Someone must have invented it many decades ago. Who was that great homo-sapien? I was curious to find a name to whom I can pay my gratitude every time instant coffee makes my day better, in one way or another. So, I asked Google. 

The results were ambiguous and there were multiple claimants, including someone in New Zealand and someone in Britain. I was unable to find any definite proof of claim so I asked my intuition and it agreed to crown the person who appeared on the first result on a Google search of "who invented instant coffee". And that's when I found out about Alphonse Allais! 

Side Note: If you can prove that the real inventor is someone else, please correct me by commenting here or tweeting to me @

*Alphonse in his usual creative mode*

Alphonse Allais was a french writer and humorist. He invented instant coffee in 1881. He wasn't the cliched inventor who is miserable while toiling away relentlessly on his work. Alp
