### Friendly Short Bio

I'm an independent consultant — experimenting generalist currently revolving around datastory-building and web-strategy for internet-first projects and businesses. 

I have worked on predictive modeling (data-science), web-content writing, e-commerce and designing digital systems. 

I also like to dabble in living space design, small city living, neural networks(AI), classical stoicism, absurdism, anthropology and intangible cultural heritage management. 

### Talk to Me

I currently live in Dharamshala, a small, mountain city in the foothills of western Himalayas. Dalai Lama lives nearby. Here's my [CouchSurfing profile](https://www.couchsurfing.com/people/vinay_kumar_5) *(if you want to hang out with me physically or virtually).*
