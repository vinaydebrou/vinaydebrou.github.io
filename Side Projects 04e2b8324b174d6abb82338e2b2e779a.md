# Side Projects

## Short Bio

Iâ€™m an independent low-code data-scientist. I enjoy finding and telling stories out of data. I use available data tools with minimal coding to find and grab the low-hanging fruits for early-stage businesses.

I default to using no-code tools like AirTable, MixPanel, Tableau, and Google Analytics among others to dig into data, structure it and find actionable insights.

As needed, I use Python, SQL, statistical techniques and predictive modeling to code for data-analysis and insight-extraction to answer business questions that matter.
