<p>The working arrangement is usually just ongoing email/slack interactions, with 1:1 video-conference sparring sessions of 1-3 hours every 4-6 weeks (more or less often depending on the pace of developments). Occasionally a client will rope in a colleague or direct report to help drill down into a particular issue. There is usually no output product as such, beyond the summary email notes I send after every call.</p>

<p>Occasionally, I take on projects such as building system models, or preparing and delivering private workshops on specific topics at the request of clients.</p>

<p>My consulting model is best-suited for executives in medium-to-large organizations, and requires interactions over at least a year to yield results. Occasionally, I work with individuals, leaders at smaller companies and startups (typically past the product-market fit stage, with at least 25-30 employees and/or investment/revenue in the millions of dollars).</p>

<p> Clients usually find me directly through something I've written, rather than through a referral. Check out the <a href="#writing">writing section</a>. The links below are to some of my more business-themed blog posts, but it is often a non-businsess post that triggers a great sparring relationship.</p>

I am an independent consultant and a steward of data and brand strategy for businesses that leverage the web for their survival.

I am an experimenting generalist. My background by education is in computer science. I attended the Computer Science & Engineering undergraduate program of India’s top engineering college, Indian Institute of Technology.

In my 3 years of professional experience, I have helped clients navigate the subtleties of the web. My clients include web-based businesses trying to reach product-market fit, independent creators/researchers and senior executives in need of stewardship assistance. 

Consulting
I mostly work with web-based businesses. Past clients include early-stage SaaS startups, e-commerce companies and independent creators. In my consulting, I offer a specific combination of strategy & stewardship to clients in need of external help to tune the Product-Market Fit of their business.
Even though I have the experience of doing stewardship work in specific domain silos, my consulting service is not so much about implementing a domain-specific feature. It's centered around helping a client traverse through the messy process of configuring together the multiple moving pieces of a relatively new web-based business into a coherent-enough go-to-market strategy.
This can involve helping the client as needed with: market-research, conversion-rate optimization, data analytics, configuring brand-strategy and product-development assistance. More importantly, it involves sensemaking sessions with the client to connect the dots across these domains to come up with a 'more whole' strategy and an implementation plan.

Past Projects

The domains in which I have assisted my past clients include:

Making sense of the data using data-science tools and business heuristics; and offer recommendations for the go-to-market strategy.

Build a digital system using low-code/ no-code tools. Examples include a content production system, an inventory-management database & an e-commerce store.

Review the conversion-funnel structure for conversion-rate optimization (and stewardship from website design, web-copy to email campaigns) 

Reformulate the brand strategy for the web and aligning the customer-acquisition approach to that.
