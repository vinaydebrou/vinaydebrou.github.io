  <p> Hi, my name is Vinay DÃ©brou. I am an independent consultant and Steward of Data and Brand Strategy for web based businesses and researchers. My writing can be found on <a href="https://daybrew.substack.com">Daybrew's Note</a>.</p>

<a name="consulting"><h2>Consulting</h2>

<p>The bulk of my practice comprises 1:1 work with senior executives as a conversational sparring partner, to stress test and improve the rigor and quality of their ongoing thinking about their evolving challenges. Karl Weick's short paper <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/2393789">What Theory is Not, Theorizing Is</a> is a good description of the natural process I try to build upon.</p>

<p>The working arrangement is usually just ongoing email/slack interactions, with 1:1 video-conference sparring sessions of 1-3 hours every 4-6 weeks (more or less often depending on the pace of developments). Occasionally a client will rope in a colleague or direct report to help drill down into a particular issue. There is usually no output product as such, beyond the summary email notes I send after every call.</p>

<p>Occasionally, I take on projects such as building system models, or preparing and delivering private workshops on specific topics at the request of clients.</p>

<p>My consulting models is best-suited for executives in medium-to-large organizations, and requires interactions over at least a year to yield results. Occasionally, I work with individuals, leaders at smaller companies and startups (typically past the product-market fit stage, with at least 25-30 employees and/or investment/revenue in the millions of dollars).</p>

<p> Clients usually find me directly through something I've written, rather than through a referral. Check out the <a href="#writing">writing section</a>. The links below are to some of my more business-themed blog posts, but it is often a non-businsess post that triggers a great sparring relationship.</p>
