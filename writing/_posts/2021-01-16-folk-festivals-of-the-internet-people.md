In 2021, a lot of us are doing our socialization mostly virtually and it doesn't feel like just more of what we were doing pre-pandemic. The masses on one hand are recently hitting the saturation walls of social media and are withering to find calmer and more empathetic alternative social spaces(see: [cozy web](https://maggieappleton.com/cozy-web) --- including emerging private social networks like [Column](https://joincolumn.com/))

On the other hand, online-first people like me and a lot of my friends/acquaintances in the free-agent world are reckoning with a deeper (but new) challenge: how to create a meaningful social system with a participant-list that spans the globe and is online-first. If one had to design a folk-festival for the free-agents of the internet-age, what would it look like?

I gave this question a good amount of thought and found this to be an interesting and useful avenue to explore. From my understanding of what free-agents of the webverse need from and offer to their global peers, I have included some observations that could be helpful in creating a social-system for the online-first free-agents.

A free-agent social system would include these central characteristics.

-   **Trust** (the kind that helps you avoid bureaucracy)---

    -   connecting to the grapevine of non-public specific knowledge within organizations and across organizations.

    -   lifestyle support - travel advice, coliving, emotional support, logistical help

    -   intellectual peers - hanging out in virtual cafes - free-exchange of disparate & half-baked concepts

-   **Uncertainty** (tolerating it and thinking in bets)---

    -   low legibility navigation of career trajectory --- often free-agents explore a dark forest with just a flash light and have to create their own map. It's useful to borrow and lend **custom maps***(heuristics, trade tricks, directory of real decision-makers, etc.)* from your fellow free-agents.

    -   cosmopolitan-career unlocks interdisciplinary opportunities - a positive flip side of being a free-agent and being involved in disparate disciplines is the ability to combine learnings gained in different contexts --- ideal for attacking complex problems that require multidisciplinary solutions.

    -   exposed to brutal network-effects of the free-market without a social safety net --- a free-agent has little to fall-back on except his own self-built 'crash-pad'. Connecting with fellow free-agents allow all to collectively thwart potential crashes.

-   **Synchrony/Asynchrony Management---**

    -   The Dilemma --- group synchrony(*seashanties on tiktok*) feels good and is sought after for creating social bonding. In the lack of physical proximity, this becomes critical to avoid rupture of existing bonds and form new ones.

    -   On the other hand, synchronous attention is scarce([psychological coordination tax](https://twitter.com/vgr/status/1255520099097808897?s=20)) and hence can't be scaled easily for tasks*(a mundane job, for example)* that produce only money and no meaning. Asynchronous coordination tools need to be prioritized for work-like group activities.

-   **Signaling Online**

    -   cheap-signaling --- book shelves in the Zoom backgrounds and Instagrammification of social profiles are cheap signals

    -   authenticity --- costly signals(e.g: give-first attitude, existing body of work, previous collaborations) help with positive-gatekeeping in a free-agent community

    -   searching friends/partners online --- free-agents are a small minority in their immediate physical environment and hence, need to proactively search for new friends/partners online.

### A Free-Agent Festival

[![](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F118b0a6b-842f-4205-80f7-35b2c89db3b2_372x371.png)](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F118b0a6b-842f-4205-80f7-35b2c89db3b2_372x371.png)

An online folk festival for the free-agents could:

-   create group synchrony needed to initiate new social-bonds via synchronous activities.

-   encourage exchange of 'custom maps' (as a valuable expertise-accessory) relevant to the current landscape.

-   create cross-disciplinary project ideas and self-assembled interdisciplinary teams.

-   propose better remote-work mechanisms and networked organizational structures.

-   create win-win lifestyle partnerships among free-agents.

-   create folk-art for free-agents to enable collective meaning-making around a free-agent lifestyle.

If you're a free-agent, I'd love to hear your thoughts on this idea.
