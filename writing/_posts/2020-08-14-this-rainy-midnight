White peacocks dancing in the clouds

raindrops skiing down the window glass,

the earthy fragrance is in the air

loopy music in my earphones is spitting bass.

I got drenched in the drizzle

and the cherry blooms asked me for a date,

I was lying awake on my couch

when this rainy midnight came knocking on my gate.

worms of stress are crawling out of my head

finding holes to escape the burning sunshine,

the texture of curtains is staying with me

and I feel fine.
