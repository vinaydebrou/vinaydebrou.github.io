Trees are green and full of energy, shedding the old leaves 
Water flows in unending rythym
The mountains stand in front of me in confidence
I woke up before the sun to-day

I now see it making golden outlines on that cloud
as it touches the highest tip of the mountains. 
The therapeutic sound of water stream by my side. 
Oh the chirps of these little birds are filling the air

While the insects of the night screech no more
People are waking up getting into the chores of the day
Just like the vines in my garden, growing another inch with every day.
The owl is looking for a place without disturbance

That is what I seek. 
I find it among the nature, in my garden in the hills. 
The fresh air I breathe and the ground I sit upon, 
all is well when I am aligned with nature.
